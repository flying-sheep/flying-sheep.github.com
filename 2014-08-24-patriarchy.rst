On Patriarchy
=============

Due to the currently going on shitstorm of epic proportions called the Quinnspiracy_, I felt the urge to say something foundational.

All bigger societies are patriarchic. This greatly disadvantages women due to obvious insanities like their lower wages and credibility with the same qualification, but also `disadvantages men`_ in a less obvious way.

This gives rise to feministic and men’s rights advocates, among them fundamental and raging idiots that don’t trust either men or women, as well as moderate voices (which are, as always, more silent).

It also gives rise to people disregarding one or the other side of the coin, and people exploiting the shit out of the system by recklessly using their privileges.

What I always see is the problem of misguided victim solidarity. It easily happens, because everyone understands that there’s nothing more shitty than being a victim *and* not being believed, but it also allows a side to use this as propaganda.

Now what needs to happen is that people have to scrutinize evidence *without* making a victim feel unheard. Because if Zoë Quinn fabricated most cases of her being harrassed, doxxed, hacked, or mugged, she and her supporters are currently destroying the accomplishments of feminism. And since nobody but her ever claimed anything in that vein, or even provided a single shred of evidence, this is a fucking possibility.

Don’t go on a fucking witchhunt. But don’t belive everything you’re told either. Egoistic people exist and do unspeakable things for their own gain. Neither an abusive relationship nor faking to have been in one are fictional. And none of the two is exclusive to men or women. But although it’s proven that the abusive partner is female in half of the cases, people assume that women are victims. That’s misogynist *and* man-hating, but can be and is used as female privilege.

As an anti-sexist I hate this. I hate it as much as women suffering from other aspects of this fucking patriarchy.
